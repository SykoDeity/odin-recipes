    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Gyudon (牛丼, gyūdon, beef bowl) is a popular domburi dish consisting of beef and onion served over a bowl of rice. 
        The meat and onion are cooked in a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, sugar and sake giving the dish a sweet, salty flavour.

            <li>Add beef and cook, stirring until beef is cooked through and liquid has reduced down to an intensely flavored broth, about 5 minutes. 
                Stir in ginger and simmer for 1 minute longer. Adjust seasoning with salt and sugar to taste.</li>
            <li>Divide rice between 2 to 3 bowls and top with beef and sauce mixture. 
                Garnish each bowl with a poached egg (if using), sliced scallions, beni-shoga, and togarashi. Serve immediately.</li>

    <h3 id="note">Notes</h3>
        <p>Homemade dashi is nice, but not necessary for this simple dish, which has so many other strong flavors. 
            Look for thinly shaved beef at Japanese markets, ask your butcher to shave it for you, or use frozen shaved steak intended for Philly cheesesteaks. 
            The beef can be cooked directly from the freezer if using frozen; just add a few minutes to the cooking time, and make sure to carefully stir the beef and break it apart as it thaws. 
            Beni-shoga is bright red pickled hot ginger. Togarashi is Japanese chile powder, which comes in both ichimi (chiles only) and shichimi (chiles blended with other dried aromatics) versions. 
            Either will work on this dish. All of these ingredients can be found in any Japanese market or well-stocked Western supermarket.</p>
